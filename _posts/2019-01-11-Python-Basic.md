#  Language Basics
Python is a strongly-typed and dynamically-typed language.

**Remark**
1. Strongly-typed: Intepreter always respects the types of each variable
2. Dynamically-typed: A variable is simply a value bound to a name.
3. Execution: Python is first interpreted into vytecode(.pyc) and then compiled by a VM implementation into machine instructions(Most commonly using C).
